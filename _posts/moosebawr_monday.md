Enveloped in Canadian rustique d√©cor a signature to the brand, the
entrance to Moose Bawr is like entering a cozy chalet. Perfect for
mingling, ordering a cocktail or casually dining with friends. Established
in April 2014, Moose Bawr has quickly become a popular destination for
those in search of a neighborhood tavern for after work drinks or to take
in a sporting event. 

Specializing in Canadian pub fare, diners can take
in the view from 1817 Ste Catherine Ouest.
